<p>Snails are shelled mollusks, which are a group of animals which</br>
includes clams, squid and slugs. They are also invertebrates which</br>
means they do not have a backbone. Snails have 4 tentacles. The </br>
top pair are for seeing and the bottom pair are for feeling.</br>
They do not have any legs so instead they use a muscular foot for </br>
sliding. </p>

<p>Snails live in damp places such as rainforests, trees, dirt </br>
and bushes. Sea snails live in saltwater or freshwater. Snails usually</br>
come out in wet weather because they love water. A Lot of the time, </br>
they leave home and find more wet places.</p>
</head>

<head>
<p>Snails eat cucumber, lettuce, parsley, banana peels and sometimes potato.</br>
They do not eat tomato, orange, lemon, grapefruit and meat. </br>
Snails can even eat each other!</p>
</head>


<head>
<p>Snail slime is made up of mucus which helps the snail move. The mucus also </br>
protects the snail from sharp objects. It can also prevent the snail from </br>
drying out.</p>
</head>

<head>
<p>The average lifespan of a snail is 2 - 5 years. Some snails can live up to 10 </br>
years and 25 years if they have been hibernating for a very long time. Snails can </br>
hibernate for up to 3 years (if they want to).</p>

<p>Snails sense things with their eyes, feelers, skin,</p><button onclick="define1()">pneumostome,</button><p> and their mouth.</br>
Snails don’t have any ears and they don’t need them. Snails eyes are for seeing and</br> 
their feelers and skin are for feeling things.</p>
